## A Curious Animal

Yet another tech blog by [@acanimal](https://twitter.com/acanimal).

---

Created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) from the starter [julia](https://github.com/niklasmtj/gatsby-starter-julia) and made a bunch of modifications:

- Allowed to create pages as markdown: about, project, etc
- Blog section
  - Paginated
  - Follow the jekyll slug `/YYYY/MM/DD/title`
- Autodeploy to github with `> yarn run deploy`

> Note the main branch is `gatsby`. When you deploy the site is built and uploaded to `master` branch, the one configured to work with gh-pages.
