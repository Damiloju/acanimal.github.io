I think it was a matter of time to make this change. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was one of the first static site generates and it's awesome but for me, as a JavaScript developer that know little about ruby language, has more sense to stay close JS world.

I heard about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) some time ago but never spent enough time to get a good ideas about its philosophy and capabilities. Finally this weekend I decided to make the change. What I found is while Jekyll is extremely good doing one thing --mainly focused on blogs--, Gatsby is a more general solution that can be good for many other things and not only a blog.

This post is about my experience in the migration process and how I implemented some features.

## Differences between Jekyll & Gatsby

> Disclaimer: I'm not a Jekyll expert so don't flame ðŸ”¥ next is my description of Jekyll for a blogger user

Jekyll is mainly focused on static sites like blogs, because of this it divides the type of content between `pages` and `posts`. If you write a markdown file in the root folder or under `_site` thay are considered pages, meanwhile if you write `.md` files in `_posts` folder they are considered posts.

In addition the post files must be named following the next rule `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` i.e. `2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md`. This is a nice rule that make your post files appears ordered in disk.

Both pages and posts have a main section so called *frontmatter* used to specified some attributes of the content like title, date, tags, ...:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
---
```

On the other hand Gatsby is a more general purpose tool that reads data from different sources, process them and generate pages and the great is what it reads, process and generates is up to you. 

Well, don't worry most of them are done automatically but you are allowed to be involved in the previous process and tune them to achieve what you need.

Note, one really important difference between Jekyll and Gatsby is designed to work with markdown content by default, both pages and posts can directly be written in markdown format, while Gatsby understand JavaScrip and React, but anyway it is easy configurable to accept other data sources like markdown files.

## Before start

I hate those shitty posts title `Migrating from X to Y in 10 minutes` so `How to build X in 20 min`, so to be honest I want to say it clear: I spent many ours last weekend migrating my site from Jekyll to Gatsby, and that includes some hours playing with Gatsby, learning its API, looking into others source code and existent staters.

Further more, I'm not a great designer. I love programming the client side but after years I have finally admitted to myself I'm not able to do visual beautiful things ðŸ˜… so I spend some time looking for a theme for my site and finally decided for the one used in the [julia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/niklasmtj/gatsby-starter-julia/) starter.

> One thing a loved about this theme is it used the [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) library for CSS styles.

One important consideration in my migration is all the content from previous site made in Jekyll is written in markdown, so I don't want to rewrite everything as JavaScript, React and HTML, the goal is simply copy&paste all these files and make them work in the new Gatsby site.

## How Gatsby works

I'm going to try to synthesize the content of the [Gastby Internal](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-internals/) section in a few sentences:

> The flow to build a Gatsby site is as follow:
> - first read data sources: this can be the JS files in the `src/pages` or any file read by a plugin like `gatsby-source-filesystem`. All this content is transformed into *gatsby nodes*. For example, each markdown file es read and converted into a node.
> - process the previous *gatsby node*: as example, here we can create and attach new properties to the node. For example here we compute a slug for each node that corresponds to a blog post.
> - create pages: we tell Gatsby engine to create a page for the nodes we desire. For example, we create a page for each blog posts, or a page for each node that correspond to a markdown *marked* as *page*,

## Analyzing the new site

After the selecting the theme for the new site I was thinking how to organize it by sections:

- Home: Simple landing page with slogan and some links to my social networks
- Blog: This should contain all my previous posts written in markdown
- Books, Projects and About: those sections are also written in markdown
- Archive: This was automatically generated in Jekyll and must also by automatically generated in Gatsby

![site](./images/2019-10_acanimal-gatsby-site.png)

So at the end I have: 
- sections written natively in JavaScript and sections written in markdown
- sections that are pages and blog posts

Write pages in Gatsby is really easy, by default all React components under `src/pages` will be transformed to a page.

## Migrating the markdown pages

I left `src/pages` as default folder to generate pages from JavaScript files and created a new folder `src/pages-markdown` for those pages writing in markdown format.

In addition, these pages must be have next properties within the frontmatter section:
- `layout: page`
- `path: /some_path`

For example:

```
---
layout: page
title: About
date: 2010-11-23 14:48
path: /about
---
```

To make Gatsby engine take into account these files in the build process first stop is to inform where to read them:

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `pages-markdown`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/pages-markdown/`,
  },
}
```

For each file found at `src/pages-markdown` Gatsby will create a *node*. Now, we can extend the `createPages` method and make Gatsby create a new page for each node. The steps can be summarized as:
- Query for all the markdown nodes read by gatsby
- Filter those nodes with `layout=page`
- Create a new page invoking `action.createPage` method and using the template file `src/templated/page.js`

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const {Â createPage } = actions
  const pageTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/page.js`);

  return graphql(
    `
    {
      allMarkdownRemark {
        edges {
          node {
            fields {
              slug
            },
            frontmatter {
              path
              layout
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    `
  ).then(result => {
    if(result.errors) {
      return Promise.reject(result.errors)
    }

    const markdownItems = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges

    // Create pages and blog post pages
    markdownItems.forEach(({ node }) => {
      if (node.frontmatter.layout === 'page') {  
        createPage({
          path: node.frontmatter.path,
          component: pageTemplate,
        })
      }
    })
  })
}
```

## Migrating posts

I have copied all my blog posts into `blog` folder, so we need to tell gatsby where to find them:

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
  options: {
    name: 'blog',
    path: `${__dirname}/blog/`,
  },
},
```

While the files are named `YYYY-MM-DD-some-title.md` we want the posts have the path `/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-some-title` in the browser so we need to create that *slug* from the file name. The way we can do is using the `onCreateNode` method:

```javascript
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, actions }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions

  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) {
    const filename = createFilePath({ node, getNode, basePath: `blog`})

    // Blog files must have format name YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    if (node.frontmatter.layout === 'post') {
      const match = filename.match(/^\/([\d]{4}-[\d]{2}-[\d]{2})-{1}(.+)\/$/)
      if (match) {
        const [, date, title] = match
        if (!date || !title) {
          console.error(`Invalid filename ${filename}. Change name to start with a valid date and title`)
        } else {
          const slug = `/blog/${slugify(date, "/")}/${title}/`
          createNodeField({
            node,
            name: `slug`,
            value: slug
          })
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, we need to tell gatsby to create a page for each blog post node. We can do it extending a bit the previous `createPages` method:

```javascript
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const {Â createPage } = actions
  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/blog-post.js`);
  const pageTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/page.js`);

  return graphql(`...`).then(result => {
    if(result.errors) {
      return Promise.reject(result.errors)
    }

    const markdownItems = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges
    
    // Create pages and blog post pages
    markdownItems.forEach(({ node }) => {
      if (node.frontmatter.layout === 'page') {  
        createPage({
          path: node.frontmatter.path,
          component: pageTemplate,
        })
      } else if (node.frontmatter.layout === 'post') {
        createPage({
          path: node.fields.slug,
          component: blogPostTemplate,
          context: {
            slug: node.fields.slug,
          },
        })
      }
    })
  })
}
```

## Paginating the blog posts

What we desire is a blog section that lists all posts, really a paginated list of posts, and then let user select one to be read.

The previous section creates a page for each post so we need to create the pages that list the posts.

Again, we only need to update a bit the `createPages` method to create a new page for each set of six posts:

```javascript
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const {Â createPage } = actions
  const blogListTemplate = path.resolve("./src/templates/blog-list.js")
  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/blog-post.js`)
  const pageTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/page.js`)

  return graphql(`...`).then(result => {
    if(result.errors) {
      return Promise.reject(result.errors)
    }

    const markdownItems = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges

    // Create blog-list pages
    const posts = markdownItems.filter(item => item.node.frontmatter.layout === 'post')
    const postsPerPage = 6
    const numPages = Math.ceil(posts.length / postsPerPage)
    Array.from({ length: numPages }).forEach((_, i) => {
      createPage({
        path: i === 0 ? `/blog` : `/blog/${i + 1}`,
        component: blogListTemplate,
        context: {
          limit: postsPerPage,
          skip: i * postsPerPage,
          numPages,
          currentPage: i + 1,
        },
      })
    })

    // Create pages and blog post pages
    ...
  })
}
```

## Other things to take into consideration

As we saw, Gatsby knows where to read files using the plugin [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem) but how does it understand markdown format?

The answer is it doesn't, we need to use the plugin [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark) to transform markdown files into something gatsby can understand. This plugin is the responsible to read markdown files a extract information like the frontmatter, the excerpt and convert the text into HTML ready to be rendered.

The plugin `gatsby-transformer-remark`  is really powerful and also has many plugins to use within it. I have used three main plugins:
- `gatsby-remark-prismjs`: responsible to syntax highlight code within markdown files
- `gatsby-remark-images`: optimize the images used in markdown files to be production ready
- `gatsby-remark-reading-time`: adds some metadata about the estimated reading time

Finally, note in Jekyll I used the text `<!--more-->` to mark the excerpt of the post. We can easily set it configuring the plugin `gatsby-transformer-remark`:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
  options: {
    excerpt_separator: `<!--more-->`
  }
}
```
